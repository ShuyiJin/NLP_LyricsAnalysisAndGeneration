That would be too demanding.
I'm just talkin' bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding.
I'm not talkin' bout knocking out heaven
with whether we're wrong or we're right.
I'm not talkin' bout hooking up and hanging out.
I'm just talkin' bout tonight.

You were sitting on your bar stool
talking to some fool who
didn't have a clue.
I guess he couldn't see
you were looking right at me
cause I was looking at you too.
Then it's ""do you wanna dance"",
""have we ever met""
You said ""hold your horses boy
I ain't that easy to get""

Go to the bank and the hardware store, put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate but cuttin' the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave

And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

I have seen without perceiving
I have been another man
Let me pierce the realm of glamor
So I know just what I am 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

Feel the angel of the present
In the mighty crystal fire
Lift me up consume my darkness
Let me travel even higher 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
As I cross the burning ground
Let me go down to the water
Watch the great illusion drown 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

I'm gonna turn and face the music
The music of the spheres
Lift me up consume my darkness 
When the midnight disappears 

I will walk out of the darkness
And I'll walk into the light
And I'll sing the song of ages
And the dawn will end the night 

I'm a dweller on the threshold 
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I cross some burning ground
And I'll go down to the water
Let the great illusion drown 

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
