You're blind from the facts on who you are
'Cause you're watchin' that garbage

The woman makes the men all pause
And if you got a woman
She might make you forget yours
There's a 5 letter word
To describe her character
But her brains being washed by an actor
And every real man that tries to approach
Come the closer he comes
He gets dissed like a roach

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch

Yo baby, you got to cut that garbage off
Yo! I want to watch the game
Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in: I'm
'a take all your soaps
An' then I'm gonna hang 'em on a rope
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause that garbage your watchin' don't make no sense
Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in baby
I'm 'a take your set an' I'm 'a throw it
Out the window
G's

Two, seven, five, four, eight
She watched she said
All added up to zero
And nothing in her head
She turns and turns
And she hopes the soaps
Are for real, she learns
That it ain't true, nope
But she won't survive
And rather die in a lie
Falls a fool, for some dude, on a tube

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch

Yo baby, you think I'm jokin'?
Do it look like I'm jokin'?
I ain't jokin', word up, baby
Yo, cut that garbage off now
Yo, I got the Tyson fight on, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, so you can't be comin' in here stackin' {aid} like that
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, we gettin' ready to watch the Super Bowl
We got a black quarterback so step back

Trouble vision for a sister
'Cause I know she don't know, I quote
Her brains retrained
By a 24 inch remote
Revolution a solution
For all of our children
But her children
Don't mean as much as the show, I mean
Watch her worship the screen, and fiend
For a TV ad
And it just makes me mad

Look, don't nobody look like that

2,2,Public Enemy,angry,It Takes a Nation of?,/album/it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back-mw0000196315,"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton

I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough

I put that on my mama and my dead homeys
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-a-dick
Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me
Tryin' to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flown
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the see-P-T

Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so
I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
'Cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be 2-10
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke
Let you on the scene to back up the Verse Team

And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys
You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs

It's calm yet wild the style that I speak 
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart 
In fact you'll start to illuminate  knowledge to others in a song 

Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge  
knowledge reigned supreme 
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens 
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious 

'Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us 
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us 
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us 
I failed your class 'cause I ain't with your reasoning 

You're tryin' make me you by seasoning 
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York 
It doesn't exist no way, no how 
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony 

African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not 
and this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot 
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life 
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that 

You must learn 

Chorus: Just like I told you, you must learn (twice) 

I believe that if you're teaching history 

Filled with straight up facts no mystery 

Teach the student what needs to be taught 

'Cause Black and White kids both take shorts 

When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture 

Ignorance swoops down like a vulture 

'Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor 

No one told you about Benjamin Banneker 

A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac 

Can't you see where KRS is coming at 

With Elie Whitney, Holly Selosy, Grand Bill Woods 

made the walky-talky 

Lewis Latterman improved on Edison 

Charles Drew did a lot for medicine 

Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights 

Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night 

Madame CJ Walker made a straightin' comb 

But you won't know this is you weren't shown 

The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh 

'Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed 

So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man 

we need the 89 school system 

One that caters to a Black return because

Fuck a punk cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine double m
The damn scum that you all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up
So what they do go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting let's see who drop
The police the media and suckers that went pop
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put em overseas they be begging to come back
They say keep em on gangs and drugs
You want to sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

But how long you live

I meet cold bitches no hoes
Don't want to sleep so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my style in
From San Quentin to Rykers Island

One time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter

The way I'm talkin I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'cause if you is or you ain't a gang banger
Keep one in the chamber
'cause you'll get them things put on ya son

They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?

So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress

Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'ma beat the wack

Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game 
And I don't hang out as much 
Bang out dope cuts 
Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts 
But when it comes to getting in a circle 
I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple 
Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke 
When deuce deuce hit the floor yo 
Now which of ya want to fade the twenty? 
I'm turnin your fat pockets skinny 
Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory 
And boom it's like they die for me 
Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint 
But don't forget my point 
There it is yo 
I put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide 
Money gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five 
I'm never hitting four-trey no way 
You want to leave but come on hoe stay 
Nigga see but that'll work 
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt 
Fool you can't even fuck with that 
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat 
Cause I see your homies starting to look 
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks 
And I'm feeling like a baller 
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller 
Now you want to go and scheme 
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team 
So I pick up my money and start walking

I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of good times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint

First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass out
When I'm rollin' in a seven deuce glass house
The Mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe ""Faces of Death"" on wax
Some say the Mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob

To be down with the Mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said ""I know you"" I said ""you might
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like""
So he soaked me up like Bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob

If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she want to try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the Mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job

The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black

Then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it

Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm living, forgiven

I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and
Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Changing some ways
To way back in the better days

Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got better get some
(Get on up) hustler of culture
Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone
