Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair

Give me fever with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn

When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""

Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""daddy-o don't you dare""

Give me fever with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn

that you gave up on me to be with her
revenge is sweeter than you ever were

I'm so mad at you right now
and I can't even find the words
and you're on the way down
I can't wait to see you burn
you try to make me hate that girl
when I should be hating you
