It's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl
Back in Bethlehem
And on that fateful day
When she was crucified
She wore Shiseido Red
And we drank tea by her side

Sweet sweet
Used to be so sweet to me

Muhammad my friend
I'm getting very scared
Teach me how to love
My brothers who don't know the law
And what about the deal
On the flying trapeze
Got a peanut butter hand
But honey do drop in
At the Dew Drop Inn

Sweet sweet
Between the boys and the bees

Moses I know
I know you've seen the fire
But you've never seen fire
Until you've seen Pele blow
And I've never seen light
But I sure have seen gold
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
Till I get my own TV show
Ashre ashre ashre ashre
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave
I got a place in the Pope's rubber robe
