feeling so far away forever search never right i be lose in ocean of night forever hop i can find memory those memory i leave behind even though i leave will i go on believe that this time be real be i lose in this feeling like a child pass through never know the reason i be home i know the way i be home feeling oh so far away i dream i dwelt in marble hall with vassal and serf at my side and of all who assemble within those wall that i be the hope and the pride i have rich all too great to count and a high ancestral name but i also dream which please me most that you love me still the same that you love me you love me still the same that you love me you love me still the same i dream that suitor seek my hand that knight upon bended knee and with vow no maiden heart could withstand they pledge their faith to me and i dream that one of that noble host come forth my hand to claim but i also dream which charm me most that you love me still the same that you love me you love me still the same that you love me you love me still the same  i walk the maze of moment but everywhere i turn to begin a new beginning but never find a finish i walk to the horizon and there i find another it all seem so surprising and then i find that i know you go there you be go forever i go there i will lose my way if we stay here we be not together anywhere be the moon upon the ocean be sweep around in motion but without ever know the reason for its flowing in motion on the ocean the moon still keep on move the wave still keep on wave and i still keep on go you go there you be go forever i go there i will lose my way if we stay here we be not together anywhere be i wonder if the star sign the life that be to be mine and would they let their light shine enough for me to follow i look up to the heaven but night have cloud over no spark of constellation no vela no orion the shell upon the warm sand have take from their own land the echo of their story but all i hear be low sound as pillow word be weave and willow wave be leave but should i be believe that i be only dream you go there you be go forever i go there i will lose my way if we stay here we be not together anywhere be to leave the tread of all time and let it make a dark line in hope that i can still find the way back to the moment i take the turn and turn to begin a new beginning still look for the answer i can not find the finish it be either this or that way it be one way or the other it should be one direction it could be on reflection the turn i have just take the turn that i be make i may be just begin i may be

to wood of dream and i follow a new world wait for me my dream my way i know that if i have heaven there be nothing to desire rain and river a world of wonder may be paradise to me i see the sun i see the star  my life go on in endless song above earth s lamentation i hear the real though far off hymn that hail a new creation through all the tumult and the strife i hear its music ring it sound an echo in my soul how can i keep from sing while though the tempest loudly roar i hear the truth it liveth and though the darkness round me close song in the night it giveth no storm can shake my inmost calm while to that rock i m cling since love be lord of heaven and earth how can i keep from sing when tyrant tremble in their fear and hear their death knell ring when friend rejoice both far and near how can i keep from sing in prison cell and dungeon vile our thought to them be wing when friend by shame be undefiled how can i keep from sing  one look at love and you may see it weave a web over mystery all ravelled thread can rend apart for hope have a place in the lover heart hope have a place in a lover heart whispering world a sigh of sigh the ebb and the flow of the ocean tide one breath one word may end or may start a hope in a place of the lover heart hope have a place in a lover heart look to love you may dream and if it should leave then give it wing but if such a love be mean to be hope be home and the heart be free under the heaven we journey far on road of life we be the wanderer so let love rise so let love depart let hope have a place in the lover heart hope have a place in a lover heart look to love and you may dream and if it should leave then give it wing but if such a love be mean to be hope be home and the heart be free hope be home and the heart be free

gangsta gangsta that be what they be yellin hopin you sophisticated motherfucker hear what i have to say  yo man there be a lot of brother out there flake and perpetrating but scared to kick reality man you be do all this dope produce you as not have a chance to show em what time it be so what you want me to do express yourself i be express with my full capability and now i be live in correctional facility because some do not agree with how i do this i get straight and meditate like a buddhist i be drop flavor my behavior be hereditary but my technique be very necessary blame it on ice cube because he say it get funky when you get a subject and a predicate add it on a dope beat and it will make you think some sucker just tickle me pink to my stomach because they do not flow like this one you know what i will not hesitate to diss one or two before i be through so do not try to sing this some drop science while i be drop english even if yella make it a capella i still express yo i do not smoke weed or sess because it be know to give a brother brain damage and brain damage on the mic do not manage nothing but make a sucker and you equal do not be another sequel express yourself express yourself go on and do it express yourself express yourself go on and do it now get back to the pg that be program and it be easy dre be back new jack be make hollow express as not their subject because they like to follow the word the style the trend the record i spin again and again and again yo you be on the other end watch a brother blend dope rhyme with no help there be no fess or guess while i be express myself it be crazy to see people be what society want them to be but not me ruthless be the way to go they know other say rhyme which fail to be original or they kill where the hip hop start forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop chart some musician cuss at home but scared to use profanity when upon the microphone yeah they want reality but you will hear none they would rather exaggerate a little fiction some say no to drug and take a stand but after the show they go look for the dopeman or they ban my group from the radio hear n w a and say hell no but you know it as not all about wealth as long as you make a note to express yourself express yourself go on and do it express yourself express yourself go on and do it express yourself from the heart because if you want to start to move up the chart then expression be a big part of it you as not efficient when you flow you as not swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis there be a little bit more to show i get rhyme in my mind embed like an embryo or a lesson all of em expression and if you start fess i get a smith and wessun for ya i may ignore your record because it have no bottom i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn it be dre on the mic get physical do the job n w a be the lynch mob yes i ama climb but you know you need this and the knowledge be grow just like a fetus or a tumor but here be the rumor dre be in the neighborhood and he be up to no good when i start express myself yella slam it because if i stay funky like this i be do damage or i ama be too hype and need a straight jacket i get knowledge and other sucker lack it so when you see dre a dj on the mic ask what it be like it be like we be get hype tonight because if i strike it as not for your good health but i will not strike if you just express yourself express yourself go on and do it express yourself express yourself go on and do it express yourself go on and do it go on and do it
