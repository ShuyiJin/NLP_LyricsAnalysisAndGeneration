Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights - went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue - umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man - one day it called to you
And I lost you, to the summer wind

And still the days, those lonely days - go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies - through nights that never end

With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance

To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

One more moondance with you in the moonlight

How to trust again,
Wanna believe that you won't do the same,
And every time we fight,
We're gettin' closer,
I slowly die inside,
I'm scared it's over

[Chorus]

Your love for me was always there,
Maybe too much for me to care,
Now that I know I messed it up,
I'd give my all to take it back

60,The Veronicas,brassy,Hook Me Up,/album/hook-me-up-mw0000796520,"have known you my whole life
When you were ten, you said you'd make me your wife
Eight years later you won me over
Just as I took the world on my shoulders

I got used to living without you
Endless phone calls and dreaming about you
Always said that you were my man to be
But I guess I was in love with your memory

You know I love you, I really do
But I can't fight anymore for you
And I don't know, maybe we'll be together again
Sometime, in another life
In another life

I know I said that I would keep my word
I wished that I could save you from the hurt
But things will never go back to how we were
I'm sorry I can't be your world

You know I love you, I really do
But I can't fight anymore for you
And I don't know, maybe we'll be together again
Sometime, in another life
In another life

The way you're holding on to me
Makes me feel like I can't breathe
Just let me go, just let me go
It just won't feel right inside
God knows I've tried

You know I love you, I really do
But I can't fight anymore for you
And I don't know, maybe we'll be together again
Sometime, in another life
In another life

In another life, in another life

61,Peter Gabriel,brassy,So,/album/so-mw0000650174,"You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back

All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Oh, let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

Show me round your fruitcage
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruitcage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

I get it right
I've kicked the habit
Shed my skin
This is the new stuff
I go dancing in (we go dancing in)
Oh, won't you show for me (show for me)
And I will show for you (show for you)
Show for me (show for me), I will show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you (show for me)
Only you
You've been coming through (show for you)
I gonna build that power
Build, build up that power, hey (show for me)

I've been feeding the rhythm (show for you)
Going to feel that power, build in you (show for me)
