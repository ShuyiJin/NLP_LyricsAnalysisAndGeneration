Lying in the long grass
Close beside her
Giving her the name
Of the one the moon loves
This will be the day she
Will remember
When she knew his heart
Was
Loving in the long grass
Close beside her
Whispering of love
And the way it leaves them
Lying in the long grass
In the sunlight
They believe it's true love
And from all around them
Flora's secret
Telling them of love
And the way it breathes
And
Looking up from eyes of
Amaranthine
They can see the sky
Is blue
Knowing that their love
Is true
Dreams they never knew
And the sky above is blue",/lyric/4294555/Enya/Flora%27s+Secret,"['International', 'New Age', 'Pop/Rock']",4:07,"['atmospheric', 'circular', 'dramatic', 'dreamy', 'elegant', 'ethereal', 'gentle', 'hypnotic']",Flora's Secret,https://www.allmusic.com/song/floras-secret-mt0013152545

All the stars were fallen embers.
Once, when night seemed forever
I was with you.

Once, in the care of morning
In the air was all belonging.
Once, when that day was dawning
I was with you.

How far we are from morning,
How far we are
And the stars shining through the darkness,
Falling in the air.

Into us our dreams were weaving.
Once, all dreams were worth keeping.
