And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older

Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way

No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um

Never be the same, never be another

Is dreaming us 
Soaring with the seagulls 
Astride the backs of eagles 

When the angels fall 
Shadows on the wall 
In the thunder's call 
Something haunts us all 

When the angels fall 
When the angels fall 

Take your father's cross 
Gently from the wall 
A shadow still remaining 
See the churches fall 

In mighty arcs of sound 
And all that they're containing 
Yet all the ragged souls 
Of all the ragged men 

Looking for their lost homes 
Shuffle to the ruins 
From the levelled plain 
To search among the tombstones 

When the angels fall 
Shadows on the wall 
In the thunder's call 
Something haunts us all 

When the angels fall 
When the angels fall 
When the angels fall 

These are my feet 
These are my hands 
These are my children 
And this is my demand 

Bring down the angels 
Cast them from my sight 
I never want to see 
A million suns at midnight 

Your hands are empty 
The streets are empty 
You can't control us 
You can't control us anymore

When the angels fall

Until her womb start spilling out babies

Shamefully saddled with three little pests

Burned his body for incurring my wrath
