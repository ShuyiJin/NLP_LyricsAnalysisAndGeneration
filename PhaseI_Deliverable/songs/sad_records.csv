That the leaves have all turned brown

The loneliness she has found

Still she waits alone at the window

Her tears grow harder to hold

 I'm gonna give you mine to hold,""

Ask he said, and ask is what I did
A tone of plea for everything you get
And I feel too much has been made
Of my fault, I don't call a spade
Ask he said, ask for what you need
Don't be shy, shyness is a little girl
And I feel if you're scolded like a child
All your elders, were once scolded too
We're just
No eyes, just ends
We're just friends
Shut it, shut it...
Shut it, shut it...
Don't shut it don't shut it don't shut it
Don't shut it don't shut it don't shut it
Don't you care ---- just pull in
Ask he said, it's how you get advice
And more than that it's talking to them
There is magic but really there's no magic
In what appears
I get quiet, I feel it all the while
No one's touched me for such a long time
And I get wounds she bathes them in salt
Never to open lightning with a bolt
Ask he said, and don't ever suppose
If you don't ask then nobody knows
We're just
Some eyes it's not
Were just old friends
Shut it, shut it...
Shut it, shut it...
