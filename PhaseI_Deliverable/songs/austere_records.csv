26,PJ Harvey,austere,White Chalk,/album/white-chalk-mw0000486087,"Farewell, my friends
Farewell, my dear ones
If I was rude
Forgive my weakness

Goodbye, my friends
Goodbye to evening parties
Remember me
In the spring

To work for your bread
Soon you must leave
Remember your families
And work for your children

I don't need much
And the older I become
I realize
My friendships

Will carry me over
In a course of distance
In a cause of sorrow
Friends that last

Will dance one more time
With me
I don't need much
But this I need",/lyric/12186211/PJ+Harvey/Before+Departure,['Pop/Rock'],3:45,"['atmospheric', 'eerie', 'spooky', 'weary', 'angst-ridden', 'austere', 'hypnotic', 'intense']",Before Departure,https://www.allmusic.com/song/before-departure-mt0032816363
27,PJ Harvey,austere,White Chalk,/album/white-chalk-mw0000486087,"Above the mountain, the mountain
An eagle is flying

High above the mountain
An eagle come down
To the soldier who falters
The soldier on the ground

By the mountain
I feel nothing
For in my own heart
Every tree is broken

The first tree will not blossom
The second will not grow
The third is almost fallen
Since you betrayed me so, since you",/lyric/12186212/PJ+Harvey/The+Mountain,['Pop/Rock'],3:10,"['atmospheric', 'eerie', 'spooky', 'weary', 'angst-ridden', 'austere', 'hypnotic', 'intense']",The Mountain,https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-mountain-mt0028193051
