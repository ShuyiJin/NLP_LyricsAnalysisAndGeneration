It's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl
Back in Bethlehem
And on that fateful day
When she was crucified
She wore Shiseido Red
And we drank tea by her side

Sweet sweet
Used to be so sweet to me

Muhammad my friend
I'm getting very scared
Teach me how to love
My brothers who don't know the law
And what about the deal
On the flying trapeze
Got a peanut butter hand
But honey do drop in
At the Dew Drop Inn

Sweet sweet
Between the boys and the bees

Moses I know
I know you've seen the fire
But you've never seen fire
Until you've seen Pele blow
And I've never seen light
But I sure have seen gold
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
Till I get my own TV show
Ashre ashre ashre ashre
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave
I got a place in the Pope's rubber robe

Cause he's making me stay in my room

I came in a little late
And my ol' man he just blew his mind
(Blew it bad)

Why did he sell my surfboard?
He cut off my hair in my sleep

I wish I could see outside
But he tacked up boards on my window
(Gosh it's dark)

I can't hit the surf, can't drag
Can't do a dog-goned thing
(Wish I could)

I tried to call up my chick
But he jerked my phone right out of the wall

They gave me some breadcrumbs
And a little glass of water
And they're out there eating steak
(Smells so good)

I ripped up my wardrobe
And I'm growing a beard
Oh when will they let me come out

I'd listen to my radio
But he took it and he's using it in his own room
(Now it's gone)

I wish I could do some homework
But I got suspended from school
