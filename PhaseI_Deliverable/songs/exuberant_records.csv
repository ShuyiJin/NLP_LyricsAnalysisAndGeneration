And when you walk
Across the room
You make my heart go
Boom boom boom
Let it all hang out
Baby, let it all hang out
And every time
You look that way
Honey child, you make my day
Let it all hang out
Like the man said let it all hang out

I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven, when you smile
When you smile
I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven, when you smile

I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven, when you smile

I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
And I'm real, real gone

Real real gone
I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know I need your help
And I'm real, real gone

Some people say
You can make it on your own
Oh you can make it if you try
I know better now
You can't stand up alone
Oh baby that is why

I'm real, real gone
I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know I need your help
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, real gone

And Sam Cooke is on the radio
And the night is filled with space
And your fingertips touch my face
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, real gone

I'm real gone
Oh Lord I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, real gone
And I'm real, real gone
I'm real gone
